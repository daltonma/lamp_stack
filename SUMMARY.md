# LAMP Stack Development Container - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This repository provides a complete, single-container LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP) development environment designed for introductory web development courses.

## Key Features

### 1. Single Container Architecture
- All components (Apache, MariaDB, PHP) run in one container
- No Docker Compose complexity
- Simple setup for students new to web development

### 2. Full LAMP Stack
- **Linux**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Apache**: 2.4 with mod_rewrite enabled
- **MariaDB**: 10.6 (MySQL compatible)
- **PHP**: 8.1 with essential extensions

### 3. Educational Configuration
- Error reporting enabled for learning
- No database password for simplicity
- Files served directly from workspace
- Multiple projects support via subdirectories

### 4. VS Code/Codespaces Integration
- DevContainer configuration for one-click setup
- Recommended PHP extensions installed
- Port forwarding configured (80 for web, 3306 for MySQL)
- Non-root user (vscode) with sudo access

## Files Created

### Core Configuration
1. `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` - DevContainer configuration
2. `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` - LAMP stack container definition
3. `.gitignore` - Excludes IDE and temporary files

### Documentation
1. `README.md` - Main documentation with setup and usage instructions
2. `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Guide for students and instructors
3. `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` - Command reference and code snippets

### Example Files
1. `welcome.html` - Welcome page explaining the setup
2. `index.php` - PHP info page for testing
3. `test-db.php` - Database connection test
4. `example-projects/` - Sample projects demonstrating organization
   - `project1/` - Simple HTML/PHP example
   - `project2/` - Form submission example

## Technical Implementation

### Apache Configuration
- DocumentRoot set to `/workspace`
- `.htaccess` support enabled (AllowOverride All)
- Directory indexes enabled for easy navigation
- Error and access logs configured

### PHP Configuration
- Display errors enabled (for learning)
- Error reporting set to E_ALL
- 64MB upload limit
- Short open tags enabled (common in tutorials)

### MariaDB Configuration
- Initialized during container build
- Root user accessible without password
- Configured to accept connections from anywhere (development only)
- Services start automatically via startup script

### Service Management
- Custom startup script at `/usr/local/bin/start-services.sh`
- Runs automatically via `postCreateCommand` in devcontainer.json
- Starts MariaDB first, waits for readiness, then starts Apache
- Services persist throughout container lifetime

## Security Considerations

This configuration is **DEVELOPMENT ONLY** and includes:
- ⚠️ No database authentication
- ⚠️ Permissive Apache configuration
- ⚠️ Error display enabled
- ⚠️ No SSL/HTTPS

These choices prioritize ease of learning over security. Clear warnings are included in all documentation.

## Educational Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: One container, one command to start
2. **Realistic**: Real LAMP stack, not a simplified simulation
3. **Flexible**: Supports multiple projects and assignments
4. **Accessible**: Works in browser via Codespaces, no local setup required
5. **Well-documented**: Multiple guides for different skill levels

## Usage Workflow

### For Students
1. Fork or use template of this repository
2. Open in Codespaces or VS Code
3. Create project folder
4. Write PHP/HTML code
5. Test at http://localhost/project-name/
6. Commit and push work

### For Instructors
1. Fork this repository
2. Customize Dockerfile if needed
3. Add starter code or templates
4. Share repository with students
5. Grade by opening student repositories in Codespaces

## Testing Status

The container has been configured with:
- ✅ Valid Dockerfile syntax
- ✅ Valid devcontainer.json (JSON validated)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Example files and projects
- ⏸️ Runtime testing requires Docker environment

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential improvements for specific course needs:
- Add phpMyAdmin for visual database management
- Include Composer for dependency management
- Add XDebug configuration for debugging
- Include additional PHP frameworks (Laravel, etc.)
- Add database backup/restore scripts
- Include CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, etc.)

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete, ready-to-use LAMP stack development environment suitable for introductory web development courses. It balances educational simplicity with real-world technology while providing comprehensive documentation for both students and instructors.
